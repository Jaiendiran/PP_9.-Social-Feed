###### Improvements and add-ons:

* Add 'Favorites' option and post filtration.
* User logs tracker.
* Comments to a post.
* A dashboard only for admin to access showcases the reports of the app and its data's.
* A landing page to the app.
* Private posts specific to each user stored as a sub-collection.







----------------------------------



###### Bugs:

* Noticed a preferences sync issue. (Fixed)
* The app loads all the posts, but it should be optimized to load the posts based on the options.











Pagination is already implemented, but it filters within the app not directly from the firestore. I have a plan, analyze it and let me know will it work or not.
